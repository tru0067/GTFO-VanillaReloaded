# Vanilla Reloaded

Vanilla Reloaded is a weapon balance mod that aims to rebalance the game's existing arsenal into a more interesting state. The goal is not to drastically alter the existing weapon balance, but instead to tone down some weapons that have become overcentralizing, while buffing some weapons that are currently underperforming. In some cases, weapons have been changed to emphasize what makes them unique from the rest of the cast, further diversifying the options available to the player.

## Changes

### Hammer

### Knife

### Bat

### Spear

*Spear felt to be the most underperforming of melee weapons. Its high damage role was noticeably overshadowed by the more manueverable Hammer. We have substantially reduced Spear's stamina usage, allowing players to better utilize the playstyle of adopting defensive positions interspersed with quick repositions. We have additionally given it some minor buffs to its damage output, so that it has meaningful compensation for its lack of maneuverability.*

Breakpoints affected: Spear will now be able to guarantee a light stagger on strikers with a light attack. Spear will now be able to kill a shooter with a light attack to the occiput.

-   Light attack damage: 2.0 -> 3.0
-   Charged precision multiplier: 1.3 -> 1.5
-   Light environment multiplier: 1.0 -> 1.5
-   Charged environment multiplier: 1.0 -> 2.0
-   Charged stamina cost: 5% -> 0%
-   Resting timer resets changed to be in line with all other melee weapons
    -   Light attack no longer resets resting timer while out of combat
    -   Shove no longer resets resting timer in combat
    -   Shove no longer resets resting timer out of combat

### Pistol

*The Pistol is already a well-rounded weapon with a solid identity. The only change we have made is reverting its range back to its earlier state.*

-   Falloff start: 6.0 -> 8.0

### HEL Revolver

*HEL Revolver was definitely overperforming at high level play. The main attraction of this weapon was its insane uptime with reload cancel, incredibly good ammo efficiency and an incredibly fast time to kill, to the point that the overpenetrating qualities just became icing on the cake. We've leaned in to the overpenetrating qualities, while toning down some other aspects of the weapon.*

-   Clip size: 8 -> 6
-   Bullet cost: 5.0 -> 6.0
    -   Rounds/refill: 18.0 -> 15.0
    -   Starting ammo: 60.0 -> 50.0
    -   Maximum ammo (excluding clip): 92 -> 76
-   Piercing (number of enemies that can be hit with a single shot): 2 -> 3

### Machine Pistol

### HEL Autopistol

### Bullpup Rifle

### SMG

### PDW

### Heavy SMG

### Carbine

### DMR

### Double Tap Rifle

### Assault Rifle

### Burst Rifle

### Rifle

### Sawed-Off Shotgun

### HEL Shotgun

### Heavy Assault Rifle

### Shotgun

### Combat Shotgun

### Choke Mod Shotgun

### Revolver

### Machinegun (Arbalist)

### Machinegun (Varuta)

### Burst Cannon

### HEL Gun

### High Caliber Pistol

### Precision Rifle

### Sniper

*Sniper is an incredibly polarizing weapon. In the hands of an experienced player, it can trivialize the threat posed by larger enemy varieties, but it also disproportionally suffers from low player accuracy and from level design that does not favor it. We feel that Sniper is very close to being in its best possible state, however, for the enormous amount of work that the weapon is capable of, we feel that its ammo reserves can sometimes be a bit too forgiving.*

-   Bullet cost: 23.0 -> 24.0
    -   Rounds/refill: 3.91 -> 3.75
    -   Starting ammo: 6.52 -> 6.25
    -   Maximum ammo (excluding clip): 10 -> 9

### HEL Rifle

### Bio Tracker

### C-Foam Launcher

### Mine Deployer

### Burst Sentry

### Auto Sentry

### Sniper Sentry

### Shotgun Sentry
