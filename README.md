# Vanilla Reloaded

Vanilla Reloaded is a weapon balance mod that aims to rebalance the game's existing arsenal into a more interesting state. The goal is not to drastically alter the existing weapon balance, but instead to tone down some weapons that have become overcentralizing, while buffing some weapons that are currently underperforming. In some cases, weapons have been changed to emphasize what makes them unique from the rest of the cast, further diversifying the options available to the player.

## Changes

### Sledgehammer

*The Sledgehammer is widely considered to be the most powerful melee weapon by a significant margin. Notably, with a fully charged hit, it is capable of outputting truly ridiculous amounts of stagger damage, allowing it to stagger chain Mothers, a mini-boss level enemy. We've toned down its charged stagger multiplier, so that giants will require a limb-break in order to stagger, and mini-boss enemies will no longer be consistently staggered.*

-   Charged stagger multiplier: 5.0 -> 1.5

### Knife

### Bat

*The Bat is a well-rounded melee, however it is largely overshadowed by the Sledgehammer. While the Sledgehammer's nerfs will let it shine as the melee with the highest stagger ability, we decided to additionally increase its light damage, to truly let its light attack shine.*

Breakpoints affected: Bat will now be able to kill a Striker with a light attack to the occiput.

-   Light attack damage: 3.0 -> 3.5

### Spear

*While the recent buffs worked wonders for Spear's usability, Spear still felt to be the most underperforming of melee weapons. We have substantially reduced Spear's stamina usage and slightly reduced its charge time, allowing players to better utilize the playstyle of adopting defensive positions interspersed with quick repositions. We have additionally given it a minor buff to its light attack damage, allowing it to hit some important breakpoints.*

Breakpoints affected: Spear will now be able to kill a Striker with a fully charged attack to the body and a light attack to the body. Spear will now be able to guarantee a light stagger on Strikers with a light attack to the body. Spear will now be able to kill a Shooter with a light attack to the occiput.

-   Light attack damage: 2.0 -> 2.5
-   Charged stamina cost: 5% -> 0%
-   Max damage charge time: 1.7 -> 1.5

### Pistol

*The Pistol is already a well-rounded weapon with a solid identity. Previously, the major drawback of this weapon was the inconsistency of its 3-shot kill on Strikers, but the recent patches have already addressed this.*

### HEL Revolver

*HEL Revolver was definitely overperforming at high level play. The main attraction of this weapon was its insane uptime with reload cancel, incredibly good ammo efficiency and an incredibly fast time to kill, to the point that the overpenetrating qualities just became icing on the cake. We've leaned in to the overpenetrating qualities, while toning down some other aspects of the weapon.*

-   Clip size: 8 -> 6
-   Bullet cost: 5.0 -> 6.0
    -   Rounds/refill: 18.0 -> 15.0
    -   Starting ammo: 60.0 -> 50.0
    -   Maximum ammo (excluding clip): 92 -> 76
-   Piercing (number of enemies that can be hit with a single shot): 2 -> 3

### Machine Pistol

### HEL Autopistol

### Bullpup Rifle

### SMG

### PDW

### Carbine

### DMR

*The DMR is already a very well-rounded weapon, with stats that make it highly effective, coupled with its great match-up in to Shooters, this made it an exceptional choice in solo play. However, its low ammo made it suffer in team environments. We've given it a slight decrease to its bullet cost to make it slightly more efficient.*

-   Bullet cost: 5.9 -> 5.2
    -   Rounds/refill: 15.25 -> 17.31
    -   Starting ammo: 50.85 -> 57.69
    -   Maximum ammo (excluding clip): 77 -> 88

### Double Tap Rifle

### Assault Rifle

### Burst Rifle

### Rifle

*We found that after increasing the range of the Pistol, the Rifle struggled to have a unique identity. While being a longer range variant of the Pistol was certainly a valuable option, we decided to give the weapon a very unique place. The Rifle will now be able to two-shot Strikers at extremely close range, allowing for an extremely effective and efficient but risky playstyle. We've additionally changed its stagger multiplier to be more in line with other weapons.*

-   Damage: 5.08 -> 5.66
-   Falloff start: 22.0 -> 6.0
-   Falloff end: 80 -> 90
-   Stagger multiplier: 1.75 -> 1.25
-   Clipsize: 14 -> 16

### Sawed-Off Shotgun

*The Sawed-Off Shotgun sits in a very strange place. On the one hand, its damage per shot and fire rate give it unrivalled burst damage for a main weapon, however, its tiny clip size and relatively long reload often leaves players in vulnerable positions when they are in the close ranges that the Sawed-Off prefers. However, the recent patches have already done a good job of improving its consistency and uptime and as a result we have made no further changes.*

### HEL Shotgun

*While HEL Shotgun is certainly a powerful weapon, it is also incredibly unique, and so, while considering possible changes to it, we endevoured not to disrupt this weapon from its highly specialized niche. We opted to slightly reduce its damage and clipsize, in order to tone down its rather polarizing damage per clip, while keeping the other elements of the weapon intact.*

-   Damage: 1.67 -> 1.56
-   Clipsize: 14 -> 12

### Heavy Assault Rifle

*As part of our changes to many of the automatic weapons, we've slightly increased the precision multiplier of the Heavy Assault Rifle in order reward player accuracy slightly more. While this doesn't change many breakpoints for this weapon, it'll hopefully still make it so that headshots feel more impactful while in team scenarios. We've additionally increased the falloff start range to be slightly higher than the machineguns that Heavy Assault Rifle directly competes with.*

-   Falloff start: 12.0 -> 20.0
-   Precision multiplier: 0.8 -> 0.9

### Heavy SMG

Moved to Special Weapon category.

*The Main Weapon category was incredibly over-filled with automatic weapons, so we have moved the Heavy SMG to the Special Weapon category. As a result, it has received a large overhaul to its stats.*

-   Damage: 2.45 -> 3.25
-   Clipsize: 33 -> 44
-   Bullet cost: 1.5 -> 1.2
    -   Rounds/refill: 60.00 -> 75.00
    -   Starting ammo: 200.00 -> 125.00
    -   Maximum ammo (excluding clip): 306 -> 191
-   Shot delay: 0.078 -> 0.054

### Shotgun

*Like the DMR, the Shotgun already has the stats to make it an extremely effective weapon, but it lacks the ammo to shine in most situations. We've given it slightly more ammo to hopefully make it a more viable pick in more scenarios.*

-   Bullet cost: 11.0 -> 10.0
    -   Rounds/refill: 8.18 -> 9.00
    -   Starting ammo: 13.64 -> 15.00
    -   Maximum ammo (excluding clip): 20 -> 23

### Combat Shotgun

*Combat shotgun has a dispropotionately large ammo pool, to the point that it dominates most of the efficiency stats, including those regarding boss killing - a role it is not at all specialized at. We've toned down its bullet cost so that it has a more reasonable ammo efficiency.*

-   Bullet cost: 4.0 -> 4.5
    -   Rounds/refill: 22.5 -> 20.0
    -   Starting ammo: 37.50 -> 33.33
    -   Maximum ammo (excluding clip): 57 -> 51

### Scattergun

*The Scattergun disproportionately trivializes most boss enemies. We've toned down its precision multiplier to reduce its damage in these encounters, and have also slightly increased its bullet cost so that it requires more thoughtful use.*

-   Precision multiplier: 0.7333 -> 0.67
-   Bullet cost: 19.15 -> 20.0
    -   Rounds/refill: 4.70 -> 4.50
    -   Starting ammo: 7.83 -> 7.50
    -   Maximum ammo (excluding clip): 12 -> 11

### Choke Mod Shotgun

### Revolver

*Revolver is a solid option into smaller enemies but disproportionally suffers into larger enemy variants. We've swapped its damage with that of HEL Gun in order to improve its matchup into these larger enemies. We've additionally given it a longer range flashlight, as it previously had the shortest possible flashlight range, despite being a medium range precision based weapon.*

-   Damage: 14.21 -> 16.25
-   Flashlight: Short range -> Medium range #1 (see [the wiki](https://gtfo.fandom.com/wiki/Flashlight) for more on flashlights)

### Machinegun (Arbalist)

### Machinegun (Varuta)

### Burst Cannon

*Upon its initial reintroduction to the game, the Burst Cannon was clearly unbalanced, since then, it has received two nerfs - to its ammo efficiency and its recoil - and one buff - to its damage. We have decided to revert its damage buff and slightly tone down the increased recoil. With these changes, Burst Cannon will continue to be an incredibly potent weapon, while keeping clear downsides in both its ammo economy and its handling, as well as returning to requiring substantial follow-up for efficient kills on giants.*

-   Damage: 22.0 -> 20.01
-   Reduced recoil
    -   Minimum power: 0.6 -> 0.45 (pre-nerf was 0.2)
    -   Maximum power: 1.2 -> 0.75 (pre-nerf was 0.4)

### HEL Gun

*The HEL Gun is an extremely versatile weapon, being one of the best wave-clear options while also having a strong match up into larger enemies. We've swapped its damage with that of Revolver in order to slightly reduce its impact into larger enemy variants, while maintaining its power into smaller enemies. Additionally, we've reverted some of the changes to its charge time to hopefully improve the responsiveness of the weapon.*

-   Damage: 16.25 -> 14.21
-   Charge time: 0.3 -> 0.15

### High Caliber Pistol

### Precision Rifle

### Sniper

*Sniper is an incredibly polarizing weapon. In the hands of an experienced player, it can trivialize the threat posed by larger enemy varieties, but it also disproportionally suffers from low player accuracy and from level design that does not favor it. We feel that Sniper is very close to being in its best possible state, however, for the enormous amount of work that the weapon is capable of, we feel that its ammo reserves can sometimes be a bit too forgiving.*

-   Bullet cost: 23.0 -> 24.0
    -   Rounds/refill: 3.91 -> 3.75
    -   Starting ammo: 6.52 -> 6.25
    -   Maximum ammo (excluding clip): 10 -> 9

### HEL Rifle

*With such a high amount of potential piercing, the HEL Rifle is able to achieve absurd efficiencies. We've toned down its ammo statistics to be more reasonable.*

-   Bullet cost: 10.0 -> 11.25
    -   Rounds/refill: 9.0 -> 8.0
    -   Starting ammo: 15.0 -> 13.33
    -   Maximum ammo (excluding clip): 23 -> 20
